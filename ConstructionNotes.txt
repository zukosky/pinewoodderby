Identify a template to use, and trace out the shape on the side and top of the block

Place the belt sander upside down into the vice, with the clamp locked down on the handle of the sander. 

Place the cord of the dialer away your body where you will be holding the card. 

Grasp the trigger, and hold the block against the belt until rough shape is carved out. 

To round out the sharp edges, lightly hold the edge to be rounded against the belt sander, and twist the block back and forth about 2-3 times.  Repeat for every other edge to be rounded.

Log the weight for the shaped block

Next drill the weight holes.  There are a few options, but having one hole mostly behind the axel and a second in front of the axle gives flexibility

Place the drill guide over the locations to be drilled out.  Note that one side is angled and the opposite side is flat.  Use one that will match the grade of where the holes go, but it probably doesn't make that much of a difference. 

Drill out on a trial by error basis,, but make sure you don't drill all the way through. Drill a certain amount in, and try one or two tungsten weights to make sure they will fit.  

Next drill the axle holes.  Use the Axle hole driller.  The instructions are in google docs.  There is a knack to aligning up the hole. Hold it up directly to a light. Drill into the higher hole on the template, further away from the bottom of the car.  MAKE SURE TO USE THE INLINE HOLE; NOT THE OFFSET HOLE!  That offset hole is for raised wheels.
